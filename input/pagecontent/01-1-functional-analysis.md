This section describes the **functional use of electronic Product Information (ePI)** within the **Gravitate Health (GH)** ecosystem.  
It focuses on how ePI is discovered, accessed, interpreted, and personalized for different users to support **safe, informed, and empowered medicine use**.

---

### Purpose

The **Gravitate Health Functional Analysis** examines how the ePI — a trusted, regulator-approved source of information about medicines — can be **leveraged in daily practice** by patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs), and caregivers.  

Rather than introducing new content, Gravitate Health focuses on **enhancing the usability and relevance** of the existing ePI by tailoring it to the **individual’s context and needs**.  

This is achieved through the **Lens concept**, which filters, emphasizes, and presents ePI information in a **personalized and accessible way**.

---

### Functional Use of ePI

The ePI provides structured and standardized information about a medicine, such as:

- Therapeutic indications  
- Dosage and administration instructions  
- Contraindications and precautions  
- Adverse reactions  
- Storage and disposal instructions  

In traditional form, this information is static and identical for all users.  
In the Gravitate Health framework, ePI becomes **dynamic and user-centered**, enabling tailored access and understanding.

---

### The Lens Concept in Functional Context

The **Lens** acts as a **functional layer** between the user and the ePI.  
It does not modify the original content but **personalizes its presentation** based on user-specific parameters and context.  

#### Example functions

- **Filtering:** Only show sections relevant to a user’s condition (e.g., pregnancy, diabetes).  
- **Highlighting:** Emphasize warnings, dosage details, or interactions pertinent to a user’s medications.  
- **Simplifying:** Present complex sections in plain language or alternative formats.  
- **Linking:** Connect information from the ePI to trusted external resources (e.g., patient leaflets, educational materials).  

Each Lens configuration reflects a **functional goal** — for instance:

- *Support patient understanding of dosage and safety information*  
- *Assist clinicians in quickly identifying contraindications*  
- *Enable caregivers to manage medication safely for dependents*

### Key Functional Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Primary Users |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Personalized ePI View** | A patient accesses the ePI for a prescribed medicine; the Lens highlights information relevant to their age, condition, or treatment plan. | Patient |
| **Clinical Consultation Support** | A healthcare professional reviews ePI content filtered to clinical safety aspects (e.g., contraindications, interactions) before prescribing. | HCP |
| **Medicine Use Education** | A caregiver views simplified, visual, or multilingual ePI formats to support safe administration. | Caregiver |
| **Digital Leaflet Access** | A user scans a QR code or link to access the ePI, ensuring they always see the latest, regulator-approved version. | All |
| **Feedback Loop** | User feedback helps improve Lens configurations and understand which information is most useful or confusing. | All |

### Non-Functional Aspects (Supporting Conditions)

While the focus of this analysis is functional, certain enabling conditions are critical for success:

- **Trust:** The ePI must remain an authentic, regulator-approved source.  
- **Accessibility:** Content must be understandable to diverse audiences and usable across devices.  
- **Interoperability:** ePI should link seamlessly to digital health services and patient records.  
- **Sustainability:** The functional model should adapt as ePI formats and regulations evolve.

---

### Summary

The **functional perspective** of Gravitate Health emphasizes how ePI is **used in practice** — not just how it is stored or transmitted.  
Through the **Lens concept**, Gravitate Health enables **meaningful personalization** of trusted information, supporting:

- Safer medicine use  
- Better communication between patients and professionals  
- Informed, empowered healthcare decisions  

In this way, the ePI becomes not just a document, but a **living, user-centered information service**.
