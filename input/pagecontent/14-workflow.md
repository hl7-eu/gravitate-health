### ePI Focusing

The current app and backend is developed to work like this:

<div>{% include workflow-project.svg %}</div>
<br clear="all"/>

### ePI Full Focusing

Since this can also be implemented with server or client side focusing, we can also have:

<div>{% include wf-full.svg %}</div>
<br clear="all"/>

### ePI Focusing With List

With Lists, the workflow should be:

<div>{% include wf-list-full.svg %}</div>
<br clear="all"/>
