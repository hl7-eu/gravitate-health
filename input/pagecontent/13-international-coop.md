The ePI project aims primarily at European format of the SMPC, but the relationship with other projects is vital.
Especially the USA and Japanese counterparts.

There has been a work on the mapping between the 3:

## USPI - FHIR SPL

The data for the SPL related IG is present [here](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-spl/branches/main/toc.html)

So in terms of FHIR document, is also possible to create a mapping between sections in the Composition.

So..
