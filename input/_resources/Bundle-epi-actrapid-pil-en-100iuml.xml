                <p>Actrapid is human insulin with a fast-acting effect.</p>
                <p>Actrapid is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes
                  mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough
                  insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with Actrapid helps to
                  prevent complications from your diabetes.</p>
                <p>Actrapid will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you inject
                  it, and the effect will last for approximately 8 hours. Actrapid is often given in
                  combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin preparations.</p>

                <p>Do not use Actrapid</p>
                <p>If you are allergic to human insulin or any of the other ingredients in this
                  medicine, see section 6.<br />If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is
                  starting, see Summary of serious and very common side effects in section 4.<br />In
                  insulin infusion pumps.</p>
                <p>If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or
                  crushed.</p>
                <p>If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5.<br />If
                  the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.</p>
                <p>If any of these apply, do not use Actrapid. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or
                  nurse for advice.</p>
                <p>Before using Actrapid</p>
                <p>Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.</p>
                <p>Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the
                  cartridge. Do not use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been
                  drawn above the white label band at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the
                  result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that the cartridge is damaged, take
                  it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further instructions.</p>
                <p>Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination.</p>
                <p>Needles and Actrapid Penfill must not be shared.</p>
                <p>Actrapid Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable
                  pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.</p>
                <p>Warnings and precautions</p>
                <p>Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your
                  doctor:</p>
                <p>If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary
                  or thyroid glands.</p>
                <p>If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this
                  may affect your blood sugar level.</p>
                <p>If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.</p>
                <p>If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs
                  and the timing hereof.</p>
                <p>Skin changes at the injection site</p>
                <p>The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue
                  under the skin, such as skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin.
                  The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or
                  thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin changes at
                  the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these
                  affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may
                  tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or
                  your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p>
                <p>Other medicines and Actrapid</p>
                <p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or
                  might take any other medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and
                  this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. Listed below are the most
                  common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.</p>
                <p>Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: * Other medicines
                  for the treatment of diabetes * Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat
                  depression) * Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) * Angiotensin
                  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high
                  blood pressure) * Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)<br />*
                  Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) * Sulfonamides (used to treat
                  infections).</p>
                <p>Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: * Oral
                  contraceptives (birth control pills) * Thiazides (used to treat high blood
                  pressure or excessive fluid retention) * Glucocorticoids (such as cortisone used
                  to treat inflammation) * Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) *
                  Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used
                  to treat asthma) * Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and
                  somatic growth and pronounced influence on the body s metabolic processes) *
                  Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation).</p>
                <p>Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal
                  disorder that usually occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland
                  producing excess growth hormone) may either increase or decrease your blood sugar
                  level.</p>
                <p>Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely
                  the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar.</p>
                <p>Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) Some patients
                  with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were
                  treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart
                  failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart
                  failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or
                  localised swelling (oedema).</p>
                <p>If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist
                  or nurse.</p>
                <p>Actrapid with alcohol</p>
                <p>If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level
                  may either rise or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended.</p>
                <p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
                <p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby,
                  ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Actrapid can be used
                  during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and
                  after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of
                  hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.</p>
                <p>There are no restrictions on treatment with Actrapid during breast-feeding.</p>
                <p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while
                  pregnant or breast- feeding.</p>
                <p>Driving and using machines</p>
                <p>Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: * If you
                  have frequent hypoglycaemia. * If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia.</p>
                <p>If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and
                  ability to react and therefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine.
                  Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others.</p>
                <p>Actrapid contains sodium</p>
                <p>Actrapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actrapid is
                  essentially sodium- free .</p>

              <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                <p>Dose and when to take your insulin</p>
                <p>Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you.
                  Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.</p>
                <p>Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection
                  to avoid low blood sugar.</p>
                <p>Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has
                  switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to
                  be adjusted by your doctor.</p>
                <p>Use in children and adolescents</p>
                <p>Actrapid can be used in children and adolescents.</p>
                <p>Use in special patient groups</p>
                <p>If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of
                  age, you need to check your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your
                  insulin dose with your doctor.</p>
                <p>How and where to inject</p>
                <p>Actrapid is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must
                  never inject yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle
                  (intramuscularly). Actrapid Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin
                  using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by
                  another method.</p>
                <p>With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin
                  that you use. This may reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see
                  section 4. The best places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your
                  waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. The
                  insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should
                  always measure your blood sugar regularly.</p>
                <p>Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of.</p>
                <p>Actrapid Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin
                  delivery systems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles.</p>
                <p>If you are treated with Actrapid Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge,
                  you should use two insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin.</p>
                <p>Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged.</p>
                <p>How to inject Actrapid</p>
                <p>Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your
                  doctor or nurse and as described in your pen manual.</p>
                <p>Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button
                  fully depressed until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will
                  ensure correct delivery and limit possible flow of blood into the needle or
                  insulin reservoir.</p>
                <p>After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actrapid
                  without the needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause
                  inaccurate dosing.</p>
                <p>If you take more insulin than you should</p>
                <p>If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See
                  Summary of serious and very common side effects in section 4. If you forget to
                  take your insulin</p>
                <p>If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high
                  (hyperglycaemia). See Effects from diabetes in section 4. If you stop taking your
                  insulin</p>
                <p>Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you
                  what needs to be done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe
                  hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects from diabetes in section 4. If you
                  have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor,
                  pharmacist or nurse.</p>

                <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody
                  gets them.</p>
                <p>Summary of serious and very common side effects</p>
                <p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more
                  than 1 in people.</p>
                <p>Low blood sugar may occur if you: * Inject too much insulin. * Eat too little or
                  miss a meal. * Exercise more than usual. * Drink alcohol, see Actrapid with
                  alcohol in section 2. Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin;
                  headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary changes in
                  vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling
                  anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating.</p>
                <p>Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood
                  sugar is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even
                  death. You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the
                  hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you
                  will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are conscious. If you do not
                  respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital.</p>
                <p>What to do if you experience low blood sugar:</p>
                <p>If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar
                  snack (e.g. sweets, biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible
                  and rest. Always carry glucose tablets or high sugar snacks with you, just in
                  case.</p>
                <p>When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar
                  level is stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual.</p>
                <p>If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the
                  need for an injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of
                  low blood sugar, talk to a doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or
                  exercise may need to be adjusted.</p>
                <p>Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be,
                  including the risk of passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar.
                  Let them know that if you pass out, they must turn you on your side and get
                  medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or drink, because you
                  may choke.</p>
                <p>Serious allergic reaction to Actrapid or one of its ingredients (called a
                  systemic allergic reaction) is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be
                  life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,people.</p>
                <p>Seek medical advice immediately: * If signs of allergy spread to other parts of
                  your body. * If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being
                  sick (vomiting); have difficulty in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy.</p>
                <p>If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately.</p>
                <p>Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the
                  fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect
                  less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of
                  a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not
                  known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or
                  thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent
                  these skin changes.</p>
                <p>List of other side effects</p>
                <p>Uncommon side effects May affect less than 1 in 100 people.</p>
                <p>Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation,
                  bruising, swelling and itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually
                  disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin. If they do not disappear, or
                  if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor immediately. See also
                  Serious allergic reactions above.</p>
                <p>Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your
                  vision, but the disturbance is usually temporary.</p>
                <p>Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling
                  around your ankles and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk
                  to your doctor.</p>
                <p>Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves
                  very fast, you may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy
                  and is usually transient.</p>
                <p>Very rare side effects May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people.</p>
                <p>Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss
                  of vision): If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves
                  very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. Ask your doctor about this.</p>
                <p>Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor,
                  pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this
                  leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed
                  in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on
                  the safety of this medicine.</p>
                <p>Effects from diabetes</p>
                <p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)</p>
                <p>High blood sugar may occur if you: * Have not injected enough insulin. * Forget
                  to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. * Repeatedly inject less insulin
                  than you need. * Get an infection and/or a fever. * Eat more than usual. *
                  Exercise less than usual.</p>
                <p>Warning signs of high blood sugar: The warning signs appear gradually. They
                  include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling sick
                  (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a
                  fruity (acetone) smell of the breath.</p>
                <p>What to do if you experience high blood sugar:</p>
                <p>If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine
                  for ketones if you can, then seek medical advice immediately.</p>
                <p>These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis
                  (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of
                  sugar). If you do not treat it, this could lead to diabetic coma and eventually
                  death.</p>
