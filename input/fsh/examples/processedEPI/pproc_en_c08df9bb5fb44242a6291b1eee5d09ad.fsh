throat or tongue.
• You have a tumour of the pituitary gland (prolactinoma)
• You have a blockage or tear in your intestines 
• You have black, tarry bowel motions (stools) or notice blood in your bowel motions. This could be a sign of 
bleeding in the stomach or intestines.

• You have or had a problem where your heart cannot pump the blood round your body as well as it should 
(condition called heart failure).
• You have a problem that gives you a low level of potassium or magnesium, or a high level of potassium in

Do not take Motilium if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before taking Motilium.
Warnings and precautions
Before taking this medicine contact your doctor if:
• You suffer from liver problems (liver function impairment or failure) (see “Do not take Motilium tablets if”)
• You suffer from kidney problems (kidney function impairment or failure). It is advisable to ask your doctor 
for advice in case of prolonged treatment as you may need to take a lower dose or take this medicine less 
often, and your doctor may want to examine you regularly.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Motilium. 
Do this even if they have applied in the past.
Motilium may be associated with an increased risk of heart rhythm disorder and cardiac arrest. This risk may 
be more likely in those over 60 years old or taking doses higher than 30 mg per day. The risk also increases 
when Motilium is given together with some drugs. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking drugs to 
treat infection (fungal infections or bacterial infection) and/or if you have heart problems or AIDS/HIV (see 
“Other medicines and Motilium).
Motilium should be used at the lowest effective dose.
While taking Motilium, contact your doctor if you experience heart rhythm disorders such as palpitations, 
trouble breathing, loss of consciousness. Treatment with Motilium should be stopped.
Adolescents weighing less than 35 kg and children
Motilium should not be given to adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing less than 35 kg, or in any 
children less than 12 years of age, as it is not effective in these age groups.
Other medicines and Motilium
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines you can buy without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Motilium can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way Motilium works.
Do not take Motilium if you are taking medicine to treat:
• Fungal infections such as azole anti-fungals, specifically oral ketoconazole, fluconazole or voriconazole.
• Bacterial infections, specifically erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, moxifloxacin, pentamidine 
(these are antibiotics)
• Heart problems or high blood pressure (e.g., amiodarone, dronedarone, quinidine, disopyramide, dofetilide, 
sotalol, diltiazem, verapamil)
• Psychoses (e.g., haloperidol, pimozide, sertindole)
• Depression (e.g., citalopram, escitalopram)
• Gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., cisapride, dolasetron, prucalopride)
• Allergy (e.g., mequitazine, mizolastine)
• Malaria (in particular halofantrine)
• AIDS/HIV (protease inhibitors)
• Cancer (e.g., toremifene, vandetanib, vincamine)
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking drugs to treat infection, heart problems, AIDS/HIV or Parkinson’s 
disease.
Motilium and apomorphine 
Before you use Motilium and apomorphine, your doctor will ensure that you tolerate both medicines when used 
simultaneously. Ask your doctor or specialist for a personalised advice. Please refer to the apomorphine leaflet.
It is important to ask your doctor or pharmacist if Motilium is safe for you when you are taking any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription.
Taking Motilium with food and drink
It is recommended to take Motilium before meals, as when taken after meals the absorption of the medicine is 
slightly delayed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Motilium if:
• You are pregnant, might become pregnant or think you may be pregnant
• You are breast-feeding. It is best not to take Motilium if you are breast-feeding.
Small amounts of Motilium have been detected in breast-milk. Motilium may cause unwanted side effects 
affecting the heart in a breast-fed baby. Motilium should be used during breast feeding only if your physician 
considers this clearly necessary. Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines:
Motilium can affect your ability to drive or use machinery as it may make you sleepy. Do not drive while taking 
this medicine until you know how it affects you.
Motilium tablets contain lactose.
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.

If you take more Motilium than you should:
• If you have used or taken too many Motilium tablets contact your doctor, pharmacist or the poisons centre 
at your nearest hospital casualty department immediately. Take the carton and any tablets left with you. This 
is so the doctors know what you have taken.
In the event of overdose, symptomatic treatment could be implemented. An ECG monitoring could be 
undertaken, because of the possibility of a heart problem called prolonged QT interval.

include unusual eye movements, unusual movements of the tongue or abnormal posture (such as a twisted 
neck).

• However if it is almost time for the next dose, wait until that is due and then continue as normal.
• Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p> </div></body></html>
