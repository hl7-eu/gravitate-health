long term bone health and future fracture risk in children is uncertain. Your doctor will monitor your
child’s bone health as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Other medicines and Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. Biktarvy may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Biktarvy or other
medicines in your blood may change. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may
make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your

<p class="children pregnancy hiv difficult">If you have taken Biktarvy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection
against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects.</p>
<p class="hiv breastfeeding"><strong>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Biktarvy.</strong> This is because some of the active substances
in this medicine pass into human breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living
with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk. If you are
breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>If you take more than the recommended dose of Biktarvy you may be at higher risk of side effects of
this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).
Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. Keep or take the tablet
bottle or carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.</p>
<p><strong>If you forget to take Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Biktarvy.</p>
<p>If you miss a dose:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Biktarvy, you must take the tablet as
soon as possible. Then take the next dose as usual.</li>
<li>If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Biktarvy, then do not take the
missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at your usual time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy, take another tablet. If you vomit more than 1 hour
after taking Biktarvy you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>Do not stop taking Biktarvy without talking to your doctor. Stopping Biktarvy can seriously affect
how future treatment works. If Biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you
restart taking Biktarvy tablets.</p>
<p>When your supply of Biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a
short time. The disease may then become harder to treat.</p>
<p class="jonwort hiv">If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Biktarvy
treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several months after
stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is
not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.</p>
<ul>

particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection.

<ul>
<li class="hiv">Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present
with no obvious symptoms.</li>
<li>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms
such as:<ul>
<li class="difficult">muscle weakness</li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body</li>

<li>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious life-threatening condition which usually starts

<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the
available data).</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood
supply to the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids,
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of
the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are:<ul>
<li>joint stiffness</li>
<li>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)</li>
<li class="difficult">difficulty with movement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hiv">During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.</p>
