Skilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate
works on cells of the immune system (the body&#39;s natural defences). It changes the activity of the
immune system by reducing the production of certain substances involved in causing psoriasis.</p>
<p><strong>What Skilarence is used for</strong>
Skilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease
causing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales.</p>
<p>Response to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience
with related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to
24 months.</p>         </div>"""

<p><strong>Warnings and precautions</strong>
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Skilarence.</p>
<p>Monitoring
Skilarence may cause problems with your blood, liver or kidneys. You will have blood and urine tests
before treatment and then regularly during your treatment. This is to make sure that you are not getting</p>
<p>these complications and can continue taking this medicine. Depending on the results of these blood
and urine tests, your doctor may decide to increase the dose of Skilarence as per the advised schedule
(see section 3), maintain your dose, reduce your dose or stop treatment altogether.</p>
<p>Infections
White blood cells help your body to fight infections. Skilarence may reduce the number of your white
blood cells. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have a n infection. Symptoms include fever, pain,
aching muscles, headache, loss of appetite and a general feeling of weakness. If you have a serious
infection, either before starting treatment with Skilarence or during treatment, your doctor may advise
you not to take S kilarence until the infection has resolved.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal disorders
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will
advise you on what care you need to take during Skilarence treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Children and adolescents</strong></p>
<p>Children and adolescents below the age of 18 years should not take this medicine because it has not
been studied in this age group.</p>
<p><strong>Other medicines and Skilarence</strong>
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines.</p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dimethyl fumarate or other fumarates.</strong> The active substance in Skilarence, dimethyl
  fumarate, is also used in other medicines such as tablets, ointments a nd baths. You must avoid
  using other products that contain fumarates to prevent taking too much.</li>
<li><strong>Other medicines used to treat psoriasis,</strong> such as methotrexate, retinoids, psoralens,
  ciclosporin, or other medicines that affect the immune system (such as immunosuppressants or
  cytostatics). Taking these medicines with Skilarence could increase the risk of side effects on
  your immune system.</li>
<li><strong>Other medicines that can affect your kidney function,</strong> such as methotrexate or ciclosporin
  (used to treat psoriasis), aminoglycosides (used to treat infections), diuretics ( which increase
  urine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (used to treat pain) or lithium (used for bipolar
  disease and depression). These medicines taken together with Skilarence could increase the ris k
  of side effects on your kidneys.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get severe or prolonged diarrhoea due to using Skilarence, other medicines may not work as
well as they should. In that case, discuss your diarrhoea with your doctor. I f you are taking a
contraceptive medicine (the pill), this is especially important as the effect may be reduced and you
may need to use additional methods to prevent pregnancy. See the instructions in the patient leaflet of
the contraceptive you are taking.</p>
<p>If you need a vaccination, talk to your doctor. Certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause
infection if used during treatment with Skilarence. Your doctor can advise you what would be best.</p>
<p><strong>Skilarence with alcohol</strong>
Avoid strong alcoholic drinks (more than 50 ml of spirits containing more than 30% alcohol by
volume) during treatment with Skilarence, as alcohol can interact with this medicine. This could cause
stomach and intestinal problems.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong>
Do not take Skilarence if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, as Skilarence may harm your
baby. Use effective methods of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with
Skilarence (see also “Other medicines and Skilarence” above). In case of stomach and intestinal</p>
<p>problems that could reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, you should consult your doctor
who will advise you on additional contraceptive methods.
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Skilarence.</p>
<p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong>
Skilarence may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You may feel dizzy or
tired after taking Skilarence. If you are affected, be careful when d riving or using machines.</p>
<p><strong>Skilarence contains lactose</strong>
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor
before taking this medicinal product.</p>
<p><strong>Skilarence contains sodium</strong>
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.</p>         </div>"""

<p><strong>Dose</strong>

your body to get used to the medicine and to reduce the risk of side effects, such as stomach and
intestinal problems. The dose will be increased with 30 mg every week as shown in the table below.
When reaching a dose of 120 mg Skilarence per day, usually from week 4 onwards, you can switch to

Your doctor will check how well your condition is improving after you start taking Skilarence and will
check for side effects. If you have severe side effects after an increase in dose, your doctor may
recommend that you temporarily go back to the last dose. If the side effects are not that troublesome,
your dose will be increased until your condition is well controlled. You may not need the maximum
dose of 720 mg per day as supplied in the table above. After your condition has improved sufficiently,
your doctor will consider how to gradually reduce the daily dose of Skilarence to what you need to
maintain your improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Method of administration</strong>
Swallow Skilarence tablets whole with liquid. Take your tablet(s) during or immediately after a meal.
Do not crush, break, dissolve or chew the tablet, a s they have a special coating to help prevent
irritation of your stomach.</p>
<p><strong>If you take more Skilarence than you should</strong>
If you think you have taken too many Skilarence tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>If you forget to take Skilarence</strong>
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose at the usual time and
continue taking the medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or exactly as agreed with your doctor.
Please ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
