higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have hepatitis B infection,
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.</li>
<li><p>If you have hepatitis B infection. Liver problems may become worse after you stop taking
Biktarvy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not stop taking Biktarvy if you have hepatitis B. Talk to your doctor first. For more details, see
section 3, Do not stop taking Biktarvy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys. Your
doctor may order blood tests to monitor how your kidneys work when starting and during
treatment with Biktarvy.</p>

<p>Once you start taking Biktarvy, look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signs of inflammation or infection</li>
<li>Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately. For more information see

period of time (see Warnings and precautions).</p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Biktarvy you may still develop infections
or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.</p>
<p><strong>Children and adolescents</strong></p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg regardless
of age. The use of Biktarvy in children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg has not yet
been studied. For children and adolescents who weigh 25 kg or more, Biktarvy 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg
film-coated tablets are available.</p>
<p>Loss of bone mass has been reported in some children from 3 to less than 12 years of age who
received one of the medicinal products (tenofovir alafenamide) contained in Biktarvy. The effects on
long term bone health and future fracture risk in children is uncertain. Your doctor will monitor your
child’s bone health as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Other medicines and Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. Biktarvy may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Biktarvy or other
medicines in your blood may change. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may
make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your
blood levels.</p>
<p><strong>Medicines that must never be taken with Biktarvy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>rifampicin used to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis</li>
<li>St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety, or
products that contain it.</li>
<li>If you are taking any of these medicines, do not take Biktarvy and tell your doctor immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talk to your doctor if you are taking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>medicines used for treating HIV and/or hepatitis B, containing:<ul>
<li>adefovir dipivoxil, atazanavir, bictegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir
alafenamide, or tenofovir disoproxil</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections, containing:<ul>
<li>azithromycin, clarithromycin, rifabutin or rifapentine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy, containing:<ul>
<li>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>immunosuppressants used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant,
containing ciclosporin</li>
<li><p>ulcer-healing medicines containing sucralfate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Do not stop your treatment without
contacting your doctor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>antacids to treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, or acid reflux, containing aluminium and/or
magnesium hydroxide</li>
<li>mineral supplements or vitamins containing magnesium or iron</li>
<li>Get advice from your doctor or pharmacist before taking Biktarvy if you are taking any of
these medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Antacids and magnesium supplements: you will need to take Biktarvy at least 2 hours before
antacids or supplements containing aluminium and/or magnesium. Or you can take Biktarvy with
food at least 2 hours after.</p>
<p>Iron supplements: you will need to take Biktarvy at least 2 hours before iron supplements, or you
can take them together with food.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby,
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and
risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have taken Biktarvy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection
against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Biktarvy.</strong> This is because some of the active substances
in this medicine pass into human breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living
with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk. If you are
breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong></p>
<p>Biktarvy can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy when taking Biktarvy, do not drive or ride a bicycle
and do not use any tools or machines.</p>
<p><strong>Biktarvy contains sodium</strong></p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.</p>         </div>"""

<p>Children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg but less than 25 kg: one tablet each
day with or without food (one 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg tablet).</p>

<li>See section 2 for more information on taking these medicines with Biktarvy.</li>

<p>If you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Biktarvy following completion of dialysis.</p>
<p><strong>If you take more Biktarvy than you should</strong></p>
<p>If you take more than the recommended dose of Biktarvy you may be at higher risk of side effects of
this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).
Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. Keep or take the tablet
bottle or carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.</p>
<p><strong>If you forget to take Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Biktarvy.</p>
<p>If you miss a dose:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Biktarvy, you must take the tablet as
soon as possible. Then take the next dose as usual.</li>
<li>If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Biktarvy, then do not take the
missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at your usual time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy, take another tablet. If you vomit more than 1 hour
after taking Biktarvy you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>Do not stop taking Biktarvy without talking to your doctor. Stopping Biktarvy can seriously affect
how future treatment works. If Biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you
restart taking Biktarvy tablets.</p>
<p>When your supply of Biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a
short time. The disease may then become harder to treat.</p>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Biktarvy
treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several months after
stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is
not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment,
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</li>

<p><strong>Possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon
after HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present
with no obvious symptoms.</li>
<li>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms
such as:<ul>
<li>muscle weakness</li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body</li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor
immediately.</li>

<p><strong>Common side effects</strong>
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people)</p>
<ul>
<li>depression</li>
<li>abnormal dreams</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>diarrhoea</li>
<li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
<li>tiredness (fatigue)</li>

<p><strong>Uncommon side effects</strong></p>
<p>(may affect up to 1 in 100 people)</p>
<ul>
<li>anaemia</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>stomach pain</li>
<li>problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia)</li>
<li>wind (flatulence)</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema)</li>
<li>itching (pruritus)</li>
<li>rash</li>
<li>hives (urticaria)</li>
<li>joint pain (arthralgia)</li>
<li>suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt (particularly in patients who have had depression or
mental health problems before)</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>sleep disorders
Blood tests may also show:</li>
<li>higher levels of substances called bilirubin and/or serum creatinine in the blood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rare side effects</strong></p>
<p>(may affect up to 1 in 1000 people)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious life-threatening condition which usually starts
with flu- like symptoms. A few days later other symptoms appear including:<ul>
<li>Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off</li>
<li>Blisters on your skin, mouth, nose, and genitals</li>
<li>Red, painful, watery eyes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have any of these symptoms, stop your medicine immediately and tell your doctor
straight away.</li>
<li>If any of the side effects get serious, tell your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment</strong></p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the
available data).</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood
supply to the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids,
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of
the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are:<ul>
<li>joint stiffness</li>
<li>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)</li>
<li>difficulty with movement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting of side effects</strong>
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system

<ul>
<li><strong>Sinais de inflamação ou infeção</strong></li>
<li>D<strong>ores nas articulações, rigidez ou problemas nos ossos</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Se observar quaisquer destes sintomas, informe o seu médico imediatamente.</strong> Para obter mais
informação, consulte a secção 4, Efeitos indesejáveis possíveis.</p>
<p>Existe a possibilidade de vir a ter problemas nos rins se tomar Biktarvy durante um longo período de
tempo (ver Advertências e precauções).</p>
<p>Este medicamento não é uma cura para a infeção pelo VIH. Enquanto tomar Biktarvy pode
desenvolver na mesma infeções ou outras doenças associadas com a infeção pelo VIH.</p>
<p><strong>Crianças e adolescentes</strong></p>
<p>Não dê este medicamento a crianças com menos de 2 anos de idade, ou que pesem menos de 14 kg
independentemente da idade. A utilização de Biktarvy em crianças com menos de 2 anos de idade ou
que pesem menos de 14 kg ainda não foi estudada. Para crianças e adolescentes que pesem 25 kg ou
mais, estão disponíveis comprimidos revestidos por película de Biktarvy 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg.</p>
<p>Foi notificada perda de massa óssea em algumas crianças com idade entre 3 e menos de 12 anos que
receberam um dos medicamentos (tenofovir alafenamida) contido em Biktarvy. Os efeitos na saúde
óssea a longo prazo e o risco futuro de fratura em crianças é incerto. O seu médico monitorizará a
saúde óssea do seu filho conforme necessário.</p>
<p><strong>Outros medicamentos e Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Informe o seu médico ou farmacêutico se estiver a tomar, tiver tomado recentemente, ou se vier a tomar outros medicamentos.</strong> Biktarvy pode interferir com outros medicamentos. Como resultado, 
as quantidades de Biktarvy ou dos outros medicamentos no seu sangue podem alterar-se. Isto pode
fazer com que os seus medicamentos parem de funcionar corretamente ou piorar quaisquer efeitos
indesejáveis. Em alguns casos, o seu médico pode precisar de ajustar a sua dose ou verificar os níveis
dos medicamentos no seu sangue.</p>

<p>Informe o seu médico se estiver a tomar qualquer um destes medicamentos. Não pare o seu
tratamento sem contactar o seu médico.</p>
<p><strong>Consulte um médico ou farmacêutico se estiver a tomar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>antiácidos para tratar úlceras do estômago, azia ou refluxo ácido, contendo alumínio e/ou
hidróxido de magnésio</li>
<li>suplementos minerais ou vitaminas contendo magnésio ou ferro</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consulte o seu médico ou farmacêutico antes de tomar Biktarvy</strong> se estiver a tomar algum destes medicamentos.</p>
<p>Antiácidos e suplementos de magnésio: terá de tomar Biktarvy, pelo menos, 2 horas antes de
tomar antiácidos ou suplementos contendo alumínio e/ou magnésio. Ou pode tomar Biktarvy com
alimentos, pelo menos, 2 horas depois.</p>
<p>Suplementos de ferro: terá de tomar Biktarvy, pelo menos, 2 horas antes de tomar suplementos de
ferro ou pode tomá-los juntamente com alimentos.</p>
<p><strong>Gravidez e amamentação</strong></p>
<p>Se está grávida ou a amamentar, se pensa estar grávida ou planeia engravidar, consulte o seu
médico ou farmacêutico antes de tomar este medicamento.</p>
<ul>
<li>Se engravidar, informe imediatamente o seu médico e pergunte quais são os potenciais
benefícios e riscos da sua terapêutica antirretroviral para si e para o bebé.</li>
</ul>
<p>Se tomou Biktarvy durante a gravidez, o seu médico pode pedir-lhe para efetuar análises ao sangue e
outros testes de diagnóstico regulares para verificar o desenvolvimento da sua criança. Nas crianças
cujas mães tomaram inibidores nucleósidos da transcriptase reversa (INTR) durante a gravidez, o
benefício da menor possibilidade de infeção pelo VIH é superior ao risco de sofrerem efeitos
indesejáveis.
Não amamente durante o tratamento com Biktarvy. Isto deve-se ao facto de algumas das
substâncias ativas deste medicamento serem excretadas no leite humano. A amamentação não é
recomendada em mulheres que vivem com VIH, uma vez que a infeção pelo VIH pode ser transmitida
ao bebé através do leite materno. Se estiver a amamentar ou planeia vir a amamentar, deve falar com
o seu médico o mais rapidamente possível.</p>
<p><strong>Condução de veículos e utilização de máquinas</strong></p>
<p>Biktarvy pode causar tonturas. Se sentir tonturas enquanto estiver a tomar Biktarvy, não conduza nem
ande de bicicleta e não utilize quaisquer ferramentas ou máquinas.</p>
<p><strong>Biktarvy contém sódio</strong></p>
<p>Este medicamento contém menos do que 1 mmol (23 mg) de sódio por comprimido, ou seja, é
praticamente “isento de sódio”.</p>         </div>"""

<p><strong>Se tomar mais Biktarvy do que deveria</strong></p>
<p>Se tomar mais do que a dose recomendada de Biktarvy pode ter um maior risco de efeitos indesejáveis
com este medicamento (ver secção 4, Efeitos indesejáveis possíveis).</p>
<p>Entre imediatamente em contacto com o seu médico ou aconselhe-se junto do serviço de urgência
mais próximo. Mantenha ou leve o frasco ou embalagem de comprimidos consigo para que facilmente
possa descrever o que tomou.</p>
<p><strong>Caso se tenha esquecido de tomar Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p>É importante que não falhe nenhuma dose de Biktarvy.</p>
<p>Caso se tenha esquecido de tomar uma dose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caso se aperceba no período de 18 horas após a hora em que habitualmente toma Biktarvy,
deve necessariamente tomar o comprimido o mais rapidamente possível. Depois tome a sua
dose seguinte como é habitual.</li>
<li>Caso se aperceba 18 horas ou mais após a hora em que habitualmente toma Biktarvy, não
tome a dose que falhou. Espere e tome a dose seguinte à hora habitual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Se vomitar em menos de 1 hora após a toma de Biktarvy, tome outro comprimido. Se vomitar mais de
1 hora após a toma de Biktarvy, não necessita de tomar outro comprimido até ao seu próximo
comprimido de acordo com o esquema habitual.</p>
<p><strong>Não pare de tomar Biktarvy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Não pare de tomar Biktarvy sem falar com o seu médico.</strong> A interrupção do tratamento com
Biktarvy pode afetar gravemente a sua resposta a um tratamento futuro. Se o tratamento com Biktarvy
for interrompido por qualquer razão, fale com o seu médico antes de voltar a tomar os comprimidos de
Biktarvy.</p>
<p><strong>Quando a quantidade de Biktarvy começar a escassear,</strong> obtenha mais junto do seu médico ou
farmacêutico. É muito importante que o faça porque a quantidade de vírus pode começar a aumentar se
o medicamento for interrompido, mesmo por um curto período de tempo. A doença pode então tornarse mais difícil de tratar.</p>
<p><strong>Se tiver infeção por VIH e hepatite B,</strong> é particularmente importante não parar o tratamento com
Biktarvy sem previamente consultar o seu médico. Pode necessitar de análises ao sangue durante
vários meses após interrupção do tratamento. Em alguns doentes com doença hepática (do fígado)
avançada ou cirrose, a interrupção do tratamento não é recomendada, uma vez que pode levar a um
agravamento da sua hepatite, que pode ser potencialmente fatal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quaisquer sinais de inflamação ou infeção. Em alguns doentes com infeção pelo VIH
avançada (SIDA) e antecedentes de infeções oportunistas (infeções que ocorrem em pessoas
com um sistema imunológico fraco), podem ocorrer sinais e sintomas de inflamação de infeções
prévias logo após iniciar o tratamento contra o VIH. Pensa-se que estes sintomas são devidos a
uma melhoria na resposta imunológica do corpo, permitindo que o corpo lute contra infeções
que podem estar presentes sem sintomas óbvios.</li>
<li>Doenças autoimunes, quando o sistema imunitário ataca os tecidos saudáveis do corpo, após
começar a tomar medicamentos para a sua infeção pelo VIH. As doenças autoimunes podem
ocorrer muitos meses depois do início do tratamento. Esteja atento a quaisquer sintomas de
infeção ou outros sintomas, como:<ul>
<li>fraqueza muscular</li>
<li>fraqueza que começa nas mãos e nos pés e que progride para o tronco</li>
<li>palpitações, tremores ou hiperatividade</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Se observar estes ou quaisquer outros sintomas de inflamação ou infeção, informe o seu médico imediatamente.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Efeitos indesejáveis frequentes</strong>
(podem afetar até 1 em cada 10 pessoas)*</p>
<ul>
<li>depressão</li>
<li>sonhos anormais</li>
<li>dores de cabeça</li>

<p><em>As análises ao sangue também poderão revelar:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>níveis mais elevados de substâncias chamadas bilirrubina e/ou creatinina sérica no sangue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efeitos indesejáveis raros</strong>
<em>(podem afetar até 1 em cada 1000 pessoas)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>síndrome de Stevens-Johnson (SSJ), uma doença grave potencialmente fatal que normalmente começa com sintomas gripais. Alguns dias mais tarde, aparecem outros sintomas, incluindo:<ul>
<li>Pele dolorosa vermelha ou roxa que parece queimada e descamada</li>
<li>Bolhas na pele, boca, nariz e genitais</li>
<li>Olhos vermelhos, dolorosos e lacrimejantes</li>

<p><strong>Se tiver algum destes sintomas, pare de imediato o seu medicamento e informe logo o seu médico.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Se qualquer um dos efeitos indesejáveis se agravar informe o seu médico.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outros efeitos que podem ser observados durante o tratamento do VIH</strong></p>
<p>A frequência dos efeitos indesejáveis seguintes é desconhecida (a frequência não pode ser calculada a
partir dos dados disponíveis).</p>
<ul>
<li>Problemas nos ossos. Alguns doentes tratados com associações de medicamentos
antirretrovíricos tais como Biktarvy podem desenvolver uma doença óssea chamada
osteonecrose (morte do tecido ósseo causada pela perda da irrigação de sangue no osso). Tomar
este tipo de medicamentos durante um período prolongado, tomar corticosteroides, consumir
bebidas alcoólicas, ter um sistema imunológico muito fraco e ter excesso de peso, podem ser
alguns dos muitos fatores de risco para o desenvolvimento desta doença. Sinais de osteonecrose
são:<ul>
<li>rigidez das articulações</li>
<li>dores nas articulações (especialmente na anca, joelho e ombro)</li>
<li>dificuldade em se movimentar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Se observar qualquer um destes sintomas, informe o seu médico.</strong></p>
<p>Durante a terapêutica para o VIH pode haver um aumento do peso e dos níveis de lípidos e glucose no
sangue. Isto está em parte associado a uma recuperação da saúde e do estilo de vida e, no caso dos
lípidos no sangue, por vezes aos próprios medicamentos para o VIH. O seu médico irá realizar testes
para determinar estas alterações.</p>
