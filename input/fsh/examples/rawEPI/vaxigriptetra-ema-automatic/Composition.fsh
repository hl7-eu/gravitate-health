the vaccine, and other strains closely related to them.</p>
<p><strong>How Fluenz Tetra works</strong></p>
<p>When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can
cause the flu.
Fluenz Tetra vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs. Each year the vaccine targets four strains of
influenza, following the annual recommendations by the World Health Organisation.</p>         </div>"""

<li>if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result
of a disease, medicine or other treatment.</li>
<li>if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used

<p><strong>Warnings and precautions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if the child is less than 24 months of age. Children less than 24 months of age should not
receive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.</li>
<li>if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.</li>
<li>if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system (for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will decide if Fluenz Tetra is suitable for you.</p>
<p><strong>Other medicines, other vaccines and Fluenz Tetra</strong></p>
<p>Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or
might take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and
lower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Fluenz Tetra unless your doctor,
nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome, a very
rare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.</li>
<li>It is recommended that Fluenz Tetra is not given at the same time as influenza-specific
antiviral medicines, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is because the vaccine may work
less effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Fluenz Tetra can be given at the same time as other vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant soon or are
breast-feeding, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before receiving this vaccine. Fluenz
Tetra is not recommended for women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</li>
