## Instructions

Create Xlsx file with each tab the information for the Resource like:

*    AdministrableProductDefinition
*    Substance
*    RegulatedAuthorization
*    Organization
*    ClinicalUseDefinition
*    Composition
*    Ingredient
*    MedicinalProductDefinition
*    ManufacturedItemDefinition
*    PackagedProductDefinition
*    Bundle

Then run the creator.py with 3 arguments:
* data_file = place where the xlsx is
* template_folder = folder of the templates
* output_folder = where to place the data created

example code:  
```python creator.py data/Humalog.xlsx templates/ ../input/fsh/examples/rawEPI```

for creating all at the same time:
```python createAll.py data/ templates/ ../input/fsh/examples/rawEPI```


### Composition
The composition is where the narrative text is and requires a transformation to HTML.

The best practice so far is:
going to [this site](https://pdf2md.morethan.io/) and upload pdf and get markdown data.

From there, use it to convert to html in [here](https://markdowntohtml.com/)
