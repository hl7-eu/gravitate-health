Be sure to discuss these and other medicines you may be taking with your doctor. Losing weight may mean you need adjustments to the dose of these medicines.</p><p>To gain the maximum benefit from Xenical you should follow the nutrition program recommended to you by your doctor. As with any weight-control program, over-consumption of fat and calories may reduce any weight loss effect.</p><p>This medicine can cause harmless changes in your bowel habits, such as fatty or oily stools, due to the elimination of undigested fat in your faeces. The possibility of this happening may increase if Xenical is taken with a diet high in fat. In addition your daily intake of fat should be distributed evenly over three main meals because if Xenical is taken with a meal very high in fat, the possibility of gastrointestinal effects may increase.</p><p>The use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea.</p><p>The use of orlistat may be associated with renal stones in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. Inform your doctor whether you suffer from problems with your kidney.</p><p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>Xenical is not intended to be used in children.</p><p><strong>Other medicines and Xenical</strong></p><p>Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.</p><p>This is important as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effects of the medicines.</p><p>Xenical may modify the activity of</p><ul><li>Anticoagulant drugs (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor may need to monitor your blood coagulation.</li><li>Ciclosporin. Co-administration with ciclosporin is not recommended. Your doctor may need to monitor your ciclosporin blood levels more frequently than usual.</li><li>Iodine salts and/or levothyroxine. Cases of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur.</li><li>Amiodarone. You may ask your doctor for advice.</li><li>Medicines to treat HIV .</li><li>Medicines for depression, psychiatric disorders or anxiousness</li></ul><p>Xenical reduces the absorption of supplements of some fat soluble nutrients, particularly beta-carotene and vitamin E. You should therefore follow your doctor’s advice in taking a well balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables. Your doctor may suggest you take a multivitamin supplement.</p><p>Orlistat may unbalance an anticonvulsant treatment, by decreasing the absorption of antiepileptic drugs, thus leading to convulsions. Please contact your doctor if you think that the frequency and/or severity of the convulsions have changed when taking Xenical together with antiepileptic drugs.</p><p>Xenical is not recommended for people taking acarbose (an anti-diabetic drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus).</p><p><strong>Xenical with food and drink</strong></p><p>Xenical can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a meal. The capsule should be swallowed with water.</p><p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong> Taking Xenical during pregnancy is not recommended. You must not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Xenical as it is not known whether Xenical passes into human milk.</p><p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong> Xenical has no known effect on your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.</p></div>"
