For example: a psychotherapy episode may contain highly sensitive information, while the metadata may simply indicate that some episode happened.","The confidentiality codes can carry multiple vocabulary items. HL7 has developed an understanding of security and privacy tags that might be desirable in a Document Sharing environment, called HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS).

The use of this method is up to the policy domain such as the XDS Affinity Domain or other Trust Domain where all parties including sender and recipients are trusted to appropriately tag and enforce.   

In the HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification (HCS) there are code systems specific to Confidentiality, Sensitivity, Integrity, and Handling Caveats.

In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated. The subject of an Observation may in some cases be a procedure.  This supports the regulatory inspection use case where observations are captured during inspections of a procedure that is being performed (independent of any particular patient or whether patient related at all).","Observations have no value if you don't know who or what they're about.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Observation.subject",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
