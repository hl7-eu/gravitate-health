Your doctor will review your treatment. Do not stop taking Dovato without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and your unborn child.</p><p><strong>Breast-feeding</strong></p><p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

Such infections may have been “silent” and not detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following:</p><ul><li>headache</li><li>stomach ache</li><li>difficulty breathing. In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include:</li><li>palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor</li><li>hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)</li><li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above:</li><li>Tell your doctor immediately.

With this condition, parts of the bone tissue are permanently damaged because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more likely to get this condition:</p><ul><li>if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time</li><li>if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids</li><li>if they drink alcohol</li><li>if their immune systems are very weak</li><li>if they are overweight.</li></ul><p><strong>Signs of osteonecrosis include:</strong></p><ul><li>stiffness in the joints</li><li>aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder)</li><li>difficulty moving. If you notice any of these symptoms:</li><li><strong>Tell your doctor.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects:</strong></p><p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves.
