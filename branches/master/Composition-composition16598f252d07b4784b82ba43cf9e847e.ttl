This helps maintain the number of CD4 cells in your blood.

Such infections may have been âsilentâ and not detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following:</p><ul><li>headache</li><li>stomach ache</li><li>difficulty breathing. In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include:</li><li>palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor</li><li>hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)</li><li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above:</li><li>Tell your doctor immediately.

With this condition, parts of the bone tissue are permanently damaged because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more likely to get this condition:</p><ul><li>if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time</li><li>if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids</li><li>if they drink alcohol</li><li>if their immune systems are very weak</li><li>if they are overweight.</li></ul><p><strong>Signs of osteonecrosis include:</strong></p><ul><li>stiffness in the joints</li><li>aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder)</li><li>difficulty moving.
