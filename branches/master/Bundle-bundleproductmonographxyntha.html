If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response or an unexpectedly low yield of plasma factor VIII activity.&nbsp; In such cases, it is recommended that a specialized hemophilia center be contacted.</p><p>Reports of lack of effect, mainly in prophylaxis patients, have been received during the clinical trials and post-marketing setting.&nbsp; The lack of effect and/or low factor VIII recovery has been reported in patients with inhibitors but also in patients who had no evidence of inhibitors.&nbsp; The lack of effect has been described as bleeding into target joints, bleeding into new joints, other bleeding or a subjective feeling by the patient of a new onset bleeding.&nbsp; In order to ensure an adequate therapeutic response, it is important TO INDIVIDUALLY TITRATE AND MONITOR each patient’s dose of Xyntha, particularly when initiating treatment with Xyntha (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p>If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of Xyntha, the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient.</p><p>In a clinical trial (Study 301), 32 out of 101 (32%) previously untreated patients treated with Xyntha manufactured by the previous process developed inhibitors: 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titer &gt;5 Bethesda Units (BU) and 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titer £5 BU.&nbsp; The median number of exposure days prior to inhibitor development in these patients was 12 days (range 3 - 49 days).&nbsp; Of the 16 high responder patients, 15 received immune tolerance (IT) treatment.&nbsp; Eleven (11) of the high responders had a titer of &lt;0.6 BU at their latest available test after IT.&nbsp; In addition, IT treatment was started in 10 of the 16 low titer (£5 BU) patients, 9 of whom had titer &lt;0.6 BU for their latest value.&nbsp; Therefore, IT had an overall efficacy of 80% (20/25), 73% for high-responders and 90% for low-responders.&nbsp; Five (5) of the 6 remaining low responder patients who did not receive IT also had a titer &lt;0.6 BU for their latest value.</p><p>In a clinical trial of Xyntha manufactured by the previous process, one of 113 (0.9%) previously heavily treated patients who were evaluated for efficacy in bleeding episodes&nbsp;developed a high titer inhibitor. &nbsp;Inhibitor development in this patient occurred in the same time frame as the development of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance.&nbsp; The patient was noted initially at a local laboratory to have a treatment-emergent low titer inhibitor at 98 exposure days, which was confirmed at 2 BU at the central laboratory at 113 exposure days.&nbsp; After 18 months on continued treatment with Xyntha, the inhibitor level rose to nearly 13 BU and a bleeding episode failed to respond to Xyntha treatment.</p><p>In a pivotal phase 3 study, in which previously treated patients (PTPs) with hemophilia A received Xyntha for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, 94 subjects received at least one dose of Xyntha resulting in a total of 6775 infusions.&nbsp; In this study, the incidence of FVIII inhibitors to Xyntha was the primary safety endpoint.&nbsp; Two patients with low titer, transient inhibitors were observed in these 94 patients (2.1%).&nbsp; In a Bayesian statistical analysis, results from this study (two out of 94 subjects developed an inhibitor, 89 had 50 or more exposure days to XYNTHA) were used to update PTP results from prior supporting studies of Xyntha.&nbsp; This Bayesian analysis indicates that the&nbsp;population (true) inhibitor rate for Xyntha was below a predefined acceptable value of 4.4%; the estimate of the 95% upper limit of the true inhibitor rate was 4.07%.</p><p>In a pivotal phase 3 study for surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (study 311), one low titer persistent inhibitor and one transient false-positive inhibitor were reported.</p><p>There have been spontaneous postmarketing reports of high titer inhibitors developing in previously treated patients.</p><p>Laboratory increases in anti-FVIII antibody titers, in the absence of inhibitor development, have been observed in clinical trials.&nbsp; In a study of PTPs receiving XYNTHA for routine treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes (study 310) and for surgical prophylaxis (study 311), 1 of 94 (1%) patients, and 1 of 30 (3%) patients, respectively, developed anti-FVIII antibodies; these patients did not develop an inhibitor.&nbsp; The clinical significance of these antibodies, in the absence of an inhibitor, is unclear.</p><p>In clinical trials of PTPs receiving XYNTHA for routine treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes, 0 of 94 (0%) patients in study 310, and 3 of 110 (3%) patients in study 306/307, developed a lab increase in anti-CHO (Chinese hamster ovary, the cell line which is the source of factor VIII for XYNTHA) antibody titer, without any apparent clinical effect.&nbsp; In a study of XYNTHA for surgical prophylaxis (study 311) 1 of 30 (3%) patients developed a lab increase for antibody to CHO.&nbsp; Twenty of 113 (18%) previously treated patients (PTPs) had an increase in anti-CHO (Chinese hamster ovary, the cell line which is the source of factor VIII for Xyntha) antibody titer, without any apparent clinical effect.</p><p><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b></p><p>No interactions with other medicinal products are known.</p><p><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</b></p><p>Treatment with Xyntha<sup>&reg;</sup>should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of hemophilia A.</p><p>Xyntha<sup>&reg;</sup>is appropriate for use in adults and children including newborns.</p><p>Dosage and duration of treatment depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient’s clinical condition.&nbsp;

pharmacokinetics were evaluated during the perioperative management of patients with hemophilia A who were undergoing major surgery.&nbsp; At the baseline visit, all patients received a single dose of XYNTHA of approximately 50 IU/kg. Plasma samples were analyzed for FVIII activity using a validated one-stage (OS) clotting method.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery data are available for a total of 30 patients; the mean (±&nbsp;standard deviation [SD]) K-value was 2.11(± 0.43) IU/dL per IU/kg, and the mean (±SD) <i>in vivo</i> recovery value was 101.0%&nbsp;(±&nbsp;20%).<p><b>Chromogenic Assay</b></p><p>The labeled potency of Xyntha<sup>&reg;</sup>manufactured by the previous process is based on the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic substrate assay in which the Pfizer In-House Recombinant Factor VIII Potency Reference Standard has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using the chromogenic substrate assay.</p><p>In a crossover pharmacokinetic study of eighteen (18) previously treated patients using the chromogenic assay, the circulating mean half-life for Xyntha manufactured by the previous process was 14.8 ± 5.6 hours (ranged from 7.6 - 28.5 hours), which was not statistically significantly different from plasma-derived Antihemophilic Factor (Human), (pdAHF), which had a mean half-life of 13.7 ± 3.7 hours&nbsp; (ranged from 8.8 - 25.1 hours).&nbsp; Mean incremental recovery (K-value) of Xyntha manufactured by the previous process in plasma was 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/dL per IU/kg (ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 IU/dL per IU/kg).&nbsp; This was comparable to the mean incremental recovery observed in plasma for pdAHF which was 2.3 ± 0.3 IU/dL per IU/kg (ranged from 1.7 - 2.9 IU/dL per IU/kg).</p><p>In additional clinical studies using Xyntha manufactured by the previous process, pharmacokinetic parameters measured using the chromogenic assay were determined for previously treated patients (PTPs) and previously untreated patients (PUPs).&nbsp; In PTPs (n=101; median age 26 ± 12 years), Xyntha manufactured by the previous process had a recovery at Week 0 of 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/dl per IU/kg (range 1.1 to 3.8 IU/dl per IU/kg).&nbsp; In measurements over 4 years of use (Month 3 [n=90], Month 6 [n=87], Month 12 [n=88], Month 24 [n=70], Month 36 [n=64] and Month 48 [n=52]), the mean incremental recovery was reproducible and ranged from 2.3&nbsp;to 2.5 IU/dl per IU/kg.&nbsp; A subset of 37 study subjects had evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles at both baseline and Month 12.&nbsp; The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the mean values of Month 12-to-baseline AUCT, AUC¥, and K-value were well within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%, demonstrating the stability of these pharmacokinetic parameters over 1 year. &nbsp;In PUPs (n=59; median age 10 ± 8.3 months), Xyntha manufactured by the previous process had a mean recovery at Week 0 of 1.5&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.6 IU/dl per IU/kg (range 0.2 to 2.8 IU/dl per IU/kg).&nbsp; The mean incremental recovery for PUPs was stable over time (5&nbsp;visits during a 2-year period) and ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 IU/dL per IU/kg of Xyntha manufactured by the previous process.&nbsp; Population pharmacokinetic modeling using data from 44 PUPs led to a mean estimated half-life of Xyntha manufactured by the previous process in PUPs of 8.0 ± 2.2 hours.</p><table border="1"><thead><tr><td colspan="9" rowspan="1"><p>Table 4: Mean Factor VIII Pharmacokinetic Parameters for 37 PTPS with Both Baseline and Month 12 Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following A Rapid Infusion of Xyntha manufactured by the previous process at a Dose of 50 IU/KG</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Parameter</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>C<sub>max</sub> (IU/ml)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>AUC<sub>T</sub> (hr*IU/ml)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Half-life (hr)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>AUC<sub>¥</sub> (hr*IU/ml)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Clearance (ml/hr/kg)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Mean Residence Time</p><p>(hr)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>V<sub>ss</sub></p><p>(ml/kg)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>K-value (IU/dl/IU/kg)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Baseline</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
