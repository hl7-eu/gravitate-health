People who have the hereditary bleeding disease factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) lack this clotting factor, causing their blood to take longer to form a clot. Xyntha is a form of coagulation factor VIII.</p><p>Xyntha is used for the control and treatment of bleeding and the routine and surgical prevention of bleeding in people with hemophilia A.</p><p><b>What is does:</b></p><p>Administering Xyntha increases blood levels of factor VIII and helps prevent and control bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A. Xyntha has the same clot-promoting effects as factor VIII protein made from human plasma.</p><p><b>When it should not be used:</b></p><p>You should not take Xyntha unless your doctor confirms you have hemophilia A. Xyntha should not be used for the treatment of other clotting factor deficiencies such as von Willebrand’s disease or hemophilia B.</p><p>Xyntha is produced in hamster cells and may contain trace amounts of hamster proteins. Patients who have a known history of allergic reactions to hamster proteins should not take Xyntha. Your doctor will advise you if you have had allergic reactions to hamster proteins.</p><p>Do not use Xyntha after the expiry date printed on the pack.</p><p>Do not use Xyntha if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</p><p><b>What the medicinal ingredient is:</b></p><p>Xyntha is a coagulation factor VIII product that is produced by recombinant technology.</p><p>Xyntha does not contain any human blood or plasma, albumin, preservatives, or added animal or human components in the final product, making it naturally free from the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and parvovirus.</p><p><b>What the important nonmedicinal ingredients are:</b></p><p>Polysorbate 80 (0.4 mg/vial), Sucrose (12 mg/vial), L-Histidine (6 mg/vial), Calcium Chloride Dihydrate (1 mg/vial), Sodium Chloride (72 mg/vial) [after reconstitution with diluent].</p><p><b>What dosage forms it comes in:</b></p><p>Xyntha is supplied in kits that include single-use vials that contain nominally 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 IU per vial with pre-filled diluent syringe containing 4 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride for reconstitution.</p></div>"
