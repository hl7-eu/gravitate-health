These can be serious and occasionally deaths have occurred</li><li>rash or pinpoint flat red round spots under the skin surface or bruising of the skin. This is due to inflammation of blood vessel walls due to an allergic reaction. It can be associated with joint pain (arthritis) and kidney problems</li><li>a delayed allergic reaction can occur usually 7 to 12 days after having Amoxicillin Capsules, some signs include: rashes, fever, joint pains and enlargement of the lymph nodes especially under the arms</li><li>a skin reaction known as ‘erythema multiforme’ where you may develop: itchy reddish purple patches on the skin especially on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet, ‘hive-like’raised swollen areas on the skin, tender areas on the surfaces of the mouth, eyes and genitals. You may have a fever and be very tired</li><li>other severe skin reactions can include: changes in skin colour, bumps under the skin, blistering, pustules, peeling, redness, pain, itching, scaling. These may be associated with fever, headaches and body aches</li><li>flu-like symptoms with a rash, fever, swollen glands, and abnormal blood test results (including increased white blood cells (eosinophilia) and liver enzymes) (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)).</li><li>high temperature (fever), chills, a sore throat or other signs of an infection, or if you bruise easily. These may be signs of a problem with your blood cells</li><li>the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which occur during treatment with Amoxicillin Capsules for Lyme disease and causes fever, chills, headache, muscle pain and skin rash.</li><li>inflammation of the large bowel (colon) with diarrhoea (sometimes containing blood), pain and fever</li><li>serious liver side effects may occur.

Sometimes you may get less severe skin reactions such as:</p><ul><li>a middle itchy rash (round, pink-red patches), ‘hive-like’ swollen areas on forearms, legs, palms, hands or feet. This is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you have any of these talk to your doctor as Amoxicillin Capsules will need to be stopped.

Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to reduce the chances of these symptoms</li><li>the tongue may change to yellow, brown or black and it may have a hairy appearance</li><li>an excessive breakdown of red blood cells causing a form of anaemia. Signs include: tiredness, headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, looking pale and yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes</li><li>low number of white blood cells</li><li>low number of cells involved in blood clotting</li><li>the blood may take longer to clot than it normally would. You may notice this if you have a nosebleed or cut yourself.</li><li>Chest pain in the context of allergic reactions, which may be a symptom of allergy triggered cardiac infarction (Kounis syndrome)</li><li>Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES): DIES has been reported mainly in children receiving amoxicillin.
