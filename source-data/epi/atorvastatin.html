  <h2>1. What Atorvastatin is and what it is used for</h2>
  <p>Atorvastatin belongs to a group of medicines known as statins, which are lipid (fat) regulating medicines.</p>
  <p>Atorvastatin is used to lower lipids known as cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood when a low-fat diet and lifestyle changes alone have failed. If you are at increased risk of heart disease, Atorvastatin can also reduce such risk even if your cholesterol levels are normal. You should maintain a standard cholesterol-lowering diet during treatment.</p>

  <h2>2. What you need to know before you take Atorvastatin</h2>
  <p><strong>Do not take Atorvastatin:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>if you are allergic to Atorvastatin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</li>
    <li>if you have or have ever had a disease which affects the liver.</li>
    <li>if you have had any unexplained abnormal blood tests for liver function.</li>
    <li>if you are a woman able to have children and not using reliable contraception.</li>
    <li>if you are pregnant, or trying to become pregnant.</li>
    <li>if you are breast-feeding.</li>
    <li>if you use the combination of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in the treatment of hepatitis C.</li>
  </ul>
