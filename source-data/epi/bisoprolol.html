  <h2>1. What Bisoprolol is and what it is used for</h2>
  <p>Bisoprolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers. These medicines work by affecting the body’s response to some nerve impulses, especially in the heart. As a result, bisoprolol slows down the heart rate and makes the heart more efficient at pumping blood around the body.</p>
  <p>Bisoprolol is used to treat stable chronic heart failure. It is used in combination with other medicines suitable for this condition (such as ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, and heart glycosides).</p>

  <h2>2. What you need to know before you take Bisoprolol</h2>

    <li>have severe blood circulation problems in your limbs (e.g. Raynaud’s syndrome)</li>
    <li>have untreated pheochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland)</li>
    <li>have metabolic acidosis (too much acid in the blood)</li>
