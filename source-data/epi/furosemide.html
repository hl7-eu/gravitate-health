  <h2>1. What Furosemide is and what it is used for</h2>
  <p>Furosemide belongs to a group of medicines called diuretics (also called water tablets). It works by interfering with the filtration process of the kidneys to reduce the amount of sodium and water taken back into the bloodstream, thus increasing the volume of urine produced.</p>
  <p>Furosemide is used to treat oedema (fluid retention) caused by heart failure, certain liver and kidney disorders, blood vessel problems or high blood pressure.</p>

  <h2>2. What you need to know before you take Furosemide</h2>

    <li>have very low levels of potassium, sodium or other electrolytes in your blood, or low blood volume</li>
    <li>are dehydrated</li>
    <li>have low blood pressure</li>
