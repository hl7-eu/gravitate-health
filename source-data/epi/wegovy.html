  <h2>1. What wegovy® is and what it is used for</h2>

  <h3>What wegovy® is</h3>
  <p>wegovy® is a medicine for weight loss and weight maintenance that contains the active substance semaglutide. It is similar to a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released from the intestine after a meal. wegovy® works by acting on receptors in the brain that control your appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry and experience less craving for food. This will help you eat less food and reduce your body weight. wegovy® should be used with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity.</p>

  <h3>What wegovy® is used for</h3>
  <p><strong>Weight management</strong><br>
  wegovy® is used for weight loss and weight maintenance in addition to diet and physical activity in adults, who have:
  <ul>
    <li>a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity), or</li>
    <li>a BMI of 27 kg/m² and less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems.</li>
  </ul>
  BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height.</p>
  <p>wegovy® is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents aged 12 years and above, who have:
  <ul>
    <li>obesity, and</li>
    <li>body weight &gt; 60 kg.</li>
  </ul>
  As an adolescent patient, you should only continue using wegovy® if you have lost at least 5% of your BMI after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg dose or maximum tolerated dose (see Section 3). Consult your doctor before you continue.</p>

  <p><strong>Risk reduction of serious heart issues in adults</strong><br>
  wegovy® is used in addition to diet and physical activity to reduce the risk of serious heart issues (heart-related death, heart attacks, strokes) in adults with a history of heart disease (like a heart attack, stroke or poor blood flow to the limbs) and either obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²).</p>

  <h2>2. What you need to know before you use wegovy®</h2>

  <p><strong>Do not use wegovy® if you are:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section 6).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>
  <p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using wegovy® or during treatment if you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Effects on the digestive system</strong><br>
      During treatment with wegovy®, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney problems. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.</li>

    <li><strong>Inflammation of the pancreas</strong><br>
      If you have severe and ongoing pain in the stomach area, see a doctor straight away as this could be a sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis).</li>

    <li><strong>Diabetes</strong><br>
      wegovy® must not be used as a substitute for insulin.</li>

    <li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)</strong><br>
      wegovy® can cause low blood sugar. Please see Section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes and are taking a sulfonylurea or insulin with wegovy®, the risk of getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) might increase. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low blood sugar.</li>

    <li><strong>Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy)</strong><br>
      Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disease. If you have diabetic eye disease and experience eye problems while taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.</li>

    <li>If you know that you are due to have surgery where you will be under anaesthesia (sleeping), please tell your doctor that you are taking wegovy®.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Children and adolescents</h3>
  <p>The safety and efficacy of wegovy® in children below 12 years of age have not been studied and are not recommended for use in this population.</p>

  <h3>Other medicines and wegovy®</h3>
  <p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.</p>

  <h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>
  <p>This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it may affect your unborn child. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine. If you wish to become pregnant, you should stop using this medicine at least two months in advance. If you become or are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby when using this medicine, talk to your doctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be stopped.</p>
  <p>You should not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk.</p>

  <h3>Driving and using machines</h3>
  <p>wegovy® is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients may feel dizzy when taking wegovy® mainly during the first 3 months of treatment (see Section 4). If you feel dizzy you should not drive or operate machines until you feel better. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>
  <p>For diabetics using this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Do not drive or use machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar. See Section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for information on increased risk of low blood sugar and Section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.</p>

    <li>Leaflet</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>wegovy® FlexTouch pen (example)</h3>
  <p>Please note: Your pen may differ in size from the pen shown in the pictures.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pen cap</li>
    <li>Pen window</li>
    <li>Dose counter</li>
    <li>Dose pointer</li>
    <li>Dose selector</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>1. Prepare your pen with a new needle</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Check the name and dose of your pen</strong> to make sure it contains your prescribed dose of wegovy®. Pull off the pen cap.</li>
    <li><strong>Check that the wegovy® in your pen is clear and colourless.</strong> Look through the pen window. If wegovy® looks cloudy or coloured, do not use the pen.</li>
    <li><strong>Always use a new needle for each injection.</strong> Take a needle when you are ready to take your injection. Check the paper tab and the outer needle cap for damages. If you see any damage, this could affect sterility. Dispose of it and use a new needle. Tear off the paper tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Push the needle straight onto the pen.</strong> Turn until it is on tight.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove both needle caps.</strong> The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove both caps, otherwise you will not inject any wegovy®.
      <ul>
        <li>Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it to safely remove the needle from the pen after the injection.</li>
        <li>Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. A drop of wegovy® may appear at the needle tip. You must still check the wegovy® flow if you use a new pen for the first time. See ‘Check the flow with each new pen’ below these instructions. Never use a bent or damaged needle.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Check the flow with each new pen</strong> (only before your first injection with each new pen): 
      <ol>
        <li>Turn the dose selector until you see the flow check symbol (✔).</li>
        <li>Make sure the flow check symbol lines up with the dose pointer.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the flow:</strong> Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to “0”. The ✔ must line up with the dose pointer. A drop of wegovy® should appear at the needle tip. This drop indicates that your pen is ready for use. If a drop does not appear, check the flow again (up to two attempts). If there is still no drop, change the needle and check the flow once more. Do not use the pen if a drop of wegovy® still does not appear.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>2. Set your dose</h3>
  <p>Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops, and it shows your prescribed dose. The dashed line (—) in the dose counter will guide you to your dose. The dose selector clicks differently when turned forward, backwards or past your dose. You will hear a “click” every time you turn the dose selector. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear.</p>
  <p>When your prescribed dose lines up with the dose pointer, you have selected your dose (e.g., 0.25 mg). If the dose counter stops before you reach your prescribed dose, see the section “Do you have enough wegovy®?” below these instructions.</p>
  <h4>Choose your injection site</h4>
  <p>Choose upper arms, stomach or upper legs (keep a 5 cm distance from your belly button). You may inject in the same body area each week, but make sure it is not in the same spot as used the last time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upper arms</li>
    <li>Stomach</li>
    <li>Upper legs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Inject your dose</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Insert the needle into your skin. Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection.</li>
    <li>Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows “0.” Keep pressing the dose button with the needle in your skin and slowly count to 6 (1-2-3-4-5-6). The “0” must line up with the dose pointer. You may hear or feel a click when the dose counter returns to “0.”</li>
    <li>Remove the needle from your skin. If the needle is removed earlier, a stream of wegovy® may come from the needle tip and the full dose will not be delivered. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly on the area to stop the bleeding. You may see a drop of wegovy® at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>4. After your injection</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without touching the needle or the outer needle cap. Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on.</li>
    <li>Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the needle. Always dispose of the needle immediately after each injection to prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and inaccurate dosing. Never store your pen with the needle attached.</li>
    <li>Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect wegovy® from light.</li>
    <li>When the pen is empty, dispose of the pen (without a needle) as instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. The pen cap and the empty carton can be disposed of in your household waste.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>About your needles</h3>
  <p>Needles are medical devices.</p>
  <h4>How to identify a blocked or damaged needle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If “0” does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, you may have used a blocked or damaged needle. In this case, you have not received any wegovy® – even though the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How to handle a blocked needle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the needle as instructed in “1. Prepare your pen with a new needle” and go to “2. Set your dose.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Caring for your pen</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Treat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing. If this happens, you might not get the intended effect of wegovy®.</li>
    <li>See the back of this leaflet to read the storage conditions for your pen.</li>
    <li>Do not inject wegovy® that has been exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
    <li>Do not subject wegovy® to frost and never inject wegovy® that has been frozen. Dispose of the pen.</li>
