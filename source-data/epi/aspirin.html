  <h2>1. What Aspirin tablets is and what it is used for</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Aspirin belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet agents that help prevent your blood cells sticking together and forming a blood clot.</li>
    <li>Aspirin tablets are principally used to prevent blood clots forming following a heart attack or stroke or to help prevent heart attacks and strokes in patients who have previously suffered these conditions. They may have been prescribed for you if you have recently had by-pass surgery.</li>
